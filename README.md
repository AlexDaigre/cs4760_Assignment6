    Having trouble testing on server as I am getting the error "-bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable". Because of this I cannot run any processes on the server, and cannot turn in the project. 

    I have not found any memory leaks locally, but I am afraid something is working diffrently on the server. Alternatively, it could be something left over from the last project causing an issue.

    Bankers algorithm is not implemented fully. The code, so far, is in the project, commented out. Other than that, passing messages and granting/updating/releasing/denying resources based on basic avalibility is working. I am having no issues with the project locally.

    I had a great deal of trouble getting the msg queues set up. Basically every part of setting them up was difficult. Once set up, I found them to be fairly easy to use and more straightforward than the semaphores.

    Further, I was a bit lost when it came to turning the bankers algorithm into practical code.
